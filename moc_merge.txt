change the livery on vagrant in Set 2 (purple in sheet) , will copy the correspond livery number to insurgent in Set 1 (green in sheet)
for example change livery number 24 (in Set 2) on vagrant (in lcs it should be number 25) (which is 24 Blue & Green Camo but doesnt matter) will copy the number 24 in Set 1 to insurgent (which is unique livery 24 Stars)
